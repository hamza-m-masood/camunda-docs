Camunda 8 Self-Managed is not Camunda 7. [Find Camunda 7 documentation here](https://docs.camunda.org).

However, Optimize documentation is available for both Camunda 8 and Camunda 7, including deployment instructions available [here]($optimize$/self-managed/optimize-deployment/install-and-start). Look for `Camunda 7` badges to help you understand what content is available for what product.

:::

As an alternative to using Camunda 8 through SaaS, you can host it yourself; we call this setup Camunda 8 Self-Managed.
